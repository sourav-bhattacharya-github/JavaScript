| Variables Declaration | [var vs let vs const 📄](./01_basics/01_variables.js) | Prefer `let` and `const` for block scope and predictable behavior. Use `const` for values that shouldn't change. | **Avoid using `var`** due to hoisting and function scope issues. Prefer `const` for immutability and safer code. |
| Data Types | [JavaScript Data Types 📄](./01_basics/02_data_types.js) | JavaScript has 7 primitive types: `number` (up to 2⁵³), `bigint`, `string` (`""`), `boolean` (`true`/`false`), `null` (standalone value), `undefined`, and `symbol` (unique). Non-primitive types include objects `{}`, arrays `[]`, and functions, which are reference-based. | <span style="color:red">Primitive types are stored by value; reference types by reference. Note: `typeof null` returns `"object"` (legacy bug). Use `"use strict";` for safer, modern JavaScript.</span> |
